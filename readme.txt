Hi there, this is a patching kit for Pseudoregalia time trials. Running run.bat
will extract a level from your game pak folder, patch it, and then put a .pak
file back into your game pak folder. You'll have to edit:

- config.txt, which contains options for run.bat, and
- data.txt, which contains the time trial data

Feel free to edit run.bat as well, but you shouldn't have to.
